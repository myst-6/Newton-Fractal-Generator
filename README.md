# Newton-Fractal-Generator
I first made this project in 2017. However, having lost the source code, I decided to remake it and see these wonderful fractals again. Thanks Newton and Raphson :)

# Overview
To see more details of how the program works, head to the latest release and view its description. This repository only generates newton fractals, but once I am satisfied with this I will try make a similar program to generate Julia and/or Mandelbrot fractals. Stay on the lookout! :)
